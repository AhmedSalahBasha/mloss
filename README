FEATURES

The website contains quite a few features and is also quite specific,
so you may or may not find it useful for your means. The features include:

* a registration system for users of the site
* a database of user submitted software projects
* a rating system for the projects
* a commenting system for the projects
* access-statistics to the projects
* a blog (although articles have to be entered directly through django's
  admin interface)
* a forum
* email notifications for tracking projects and the forum
* a tool which automatically extracts projects in the "machine learning"
  section from CRAN (a repository for packages for the R programming 
  language)

The source code is organized into several sub-directories, so called
"applications". Each directory is organized more or less according to
the django standard, at least containing a definition of the models in
models.py, and of the url mappings in urls.py. If you want to find out
how a specific url is processed, have a look at the urls.py which tell
you which method takes care of the request.
